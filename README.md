# üîó JavaScript Logical Operators

JavaScript **Logical Operators** are used to perform logical operations and return Boolean results based on their operands.

---

## üìã Logical Operators Table

| Operator | Description                       | Example                | Result       |
|----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND (returns `true` if both operands are true) | `true && false` | `false` |
| `||`     | Logical OR (returns `true` if at least one operand is true) | `true || false` | `true`  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT (inverts the Boolean value) | `!true`         | `false` |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Examples of Logical Operators

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Logical AND (`&&`)**
The `&&` operator returns `true` if both operands are `true`.

```javascript
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a && b); // Output: false
console.log(a && !b); // Output: true
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Logical OR (`||`)**
The `||` operator returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.

```javascript
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a || b); // Output: true
console.log(!a || b); // Output: false
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Logical NOT (`!`)**
The `!` operator inverts the Boolean value.

```javascript
let a = true;

console.log(!a); // Output: false
console.log(!false); // Output: true
```

---

## üåü Real-World Examples

1. **Form Validation**  
   Use logical operators to validate user input.

   ```javascript
   let username = "Pratham";
   let password = "12345";

   if (username && password) {
       console.log("Form is valid!");
   } else {
       console.log("Please fill all fields.");
   }
   ```

2. **Access Control**  
   Grant access based on multiple conditions.

   ```javascript
   let isAdmin = true;
   let isLoggedIn = true;

   if (isAdmin && isLoggedIn) {
       console.log("Welcome, Admin!");
   } else {
       console.log("Access denied.");
   }
   ```

# JavaScript Ternary Operator üåü

Welcome to the **JavaScript Ternary Operator** guide! This repository contains everything you need to understand and practice using the ternary operator in JavaScript. It includes examples, explanations, and **interview practice questions** to help you prepare for your next coding interview.

## üìú Table of Contents

- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Why Use the Ternary Operator?](#why-use-the-ternary-operator)
- [Examples of Ternary Operator](#examples-of-ternary-operator)
- [10 Interview Practice Questions](#10-interview-practice-questions)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)

---

## üìù Introduction

The **ternary operator** in JavaScript is a concise way to perform conditional checks. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`. It's a shorthand for `if-else` statements and can make your code more compact and readable when used correctly.

---

## üöÄ Why Use the Ternary Operator?

- **Concise**: The ternary operator allows you to express simple conditional logic in a single line.
- **Readability**: For basic conditions, it can make the code easier to read.
- **Assigning Values**: It‚Äôs often used for assigning values based on conditions.

---

## üíª Examples of Ternary Operator

### Example 1: Basic Conditional Check

```javascript
let age = 20;
let canDrive = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canDrive); // Output: "Yes"
```

**Explanation:**  
The condition `(age >= 18)` checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If true, it returns `"Yes"`, otherwise `"No"`.

---

### Example 2: Nested Ternary Operator

```javascript
let score = 85;
let grade = (score >= 90) ? "A" : (score >= 80) ? "B" : (score >= 70) ? "C" : "D";
console.log(grade); // Output: "B"
```

**Explanation:**  
This example shows a nested ternary operator where multiple conditions are checked in sequence.

---

### Example 3: Using the Ternary Operator with Objects

```javascript
let number = 10;
let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
console.log(result); // Output: "Even"
```

**Explanation:**  
Here, we check if the number is even or odd and return the corresponding result.

## üéØ 10 Interview Practice Questions

1. **What is the ternary operator in JavaScript?**  
   - The ternary operator is a shorthand for `if-else` statements that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.

2. **Can you write an example of a ternary operator?**  
   - Yes, here‚Äôs an example:
     ```javascript
     let x = 5;
     let result = (x > 3) ? "Greater" : "Smaller";
     console.log(result); // Output: "Greater"
     ```

3. **How do you handle multiple conditions using the ternary operator?**  
   - You can use nested ternary operators. Example:
     ```javascript
     let age = 25;
     let category = (age < 18) ? "Minor" : (age <= 60) ? "Adult" : "Senior";
     console.log(category); // Output: "Adult"
     ```

4. **What is the advantage of using the ternary operator over an `if-else` statement?**  
   - The ternary operator allows for more concise code, especially when the logic is simple and you need to return or assign values based on conditions.

5. **Can the ternary operator be used for assignments?**  
   - Yes, the ternary operator is often used for assigning values based on conditions, like:
     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     let result = (x % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
     console.log(result); // Output: "Even"
     ```

6. **How would you rewrite a simple `if-else` statement using a ternary operator?**  
   - For example, converting:
     ```javascript
     if (x > 10) {
       console.log("Greater");
     } else {
       console.log("Smaller");
     }
     ```
     To a ternary operator:
     ```javascript
     console.log((x > 10) ? "Greater" : "Smaller");
     ```

7. **Can the ternary operator return more than just values?**  
   - Yes, it can return functions, objects, or other expressions. Example:
     ```javascript
     let greeting = (user) ? `Hello, ${user}!` : `Hello, Guest!`;
     console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, Guest!"
     ```

8. **What happens if you omit one part of the ternary operator?**  
   - Omitting one part will result in a syntax error. The ternary operator requires both the `true` and `false` expressions to function properly.

9. **Is it a good idea to use deeply nested ternary operators? Why or why not?**  
   - It's generally not recommended, as deeply nested ternary operators can make the code harder to read and understand. In such cases, `if-else` statements are preferred for clarity.

10. **What would happen if the ternary operator is used incorrectly, such as missing a colon?**  
    - Missing a colon (`:`) would result in a syntax error, as the ternary operator expects both the `true` and `false` expressions.

---

## üéâ Conclusion

The **ternary operator** is a great tool to write concise conditional logic in JavaScript. It‚Äôs perfect for simple conditions and can make your code more readable when used appropriately. However, avoid overusing nested ternary operators to ensure your code remains clear and easy to understand.

keep coding! üöÄ
